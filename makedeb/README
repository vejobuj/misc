A small script to install/build some Applications that are not(or poorly) available on debian without the need of keeping dozens of -dev packages installed or to mess around with make (un)install, feel free to re use - but keep in mind its made for myself and could( and will) contain bugs!

Its also made to avoid some debian GNOMEism, eg:
```
ssf@schleppi:~/Desktop$ aptitude why gconf2
i   libgnomevfs2-common Depends gconf2 (>= 2.28.1-2)
ssf@schleppi:~/Desktop$ aptitude why libgnomevfs2-common
i   libgnomevfs2-0 Depends libgnomevfs2-common (= 1:2.24.4-6)
ssf@schleppi:~/Desktop$ aptitude why libgnomevfs2-0     
i   inkscape Depends libgnomevfs2-0 (>= 1:2.17.90)
ssf@schleppi:~/Desktop$ fu*k!
```

cheers, ssf
